Reflection:

This project was a lot of fun and I was pretty pleased to work on it
the entire way through. With the help of really just one Youtube tutorial
I was able to avoid any roadblocks in coding. I made one mistake in the
process when I accidentally set a tuple for blue to appear as green which
caused me to have to go to tutoring to figure out what was wrong, but other
than that it was not too painful to code this project! It did take about
10 hours out of a Wednesday however, but not a painful 10 hours.

My only regrets are: I want to add music and animations to the game now. But...
I will save that for another day.
